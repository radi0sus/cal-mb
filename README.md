# Cal-MB

A Python 3 script for easy calibration of ‚Åµ‚Å∑Fe-M√∂√übauer (MB) spectra from a ‚Åµ‚Å∑Fe sample. 

## External modules

`lmfit`
`numpy` 
`scipy` 
`matplotlib`

## Quick start

Start the script with:
```console
python3 cal-mb.py 57Fe_calib_raw_data.ws5
```
calculates the folding point `FP`, `v0` (channel where the velocity is zero),
`vmax` (maximum velocity), and the velocity / channel `f`.

The file should contain intensities from a multi-channel analyzer. The popular WissEl format
has the extension `.ws5`. In principle any raw data (not only WissEl) can be processed. Pay 
attention to the start channel number and the folding direction.

Terminal output:
```

-------------------------------------
FP (channel) = 256.8019¬±0.0754
v‚ÇÄ (channel) = 125.7526¬±0.0858
vmax /mm¬∑s‚Åª¬π =  -4.7010¬±0.0151
f /mm¬∑s‚Åª¬π/c  =   0.0369¬±0.0001

```
You can use the first three parameters to fit MB spectra with [fit-mb](https://github.com/radi0sus/fit-mb). 

Start the script with:
```console
python3 cal-mb.py 57Fe_calib_raw_data.ws5 -s
```
calculates the same values as described above. In addition a `matplotlib` window is shown that 
summarizes the fit results.

The results will not be saved. To keep the output you have to start the script with:
```console
python3 cal-mb.py 57Fe_calib_raw_data.ws5 > calib_from_today.txt
```
To keep the figure, you have to click the floppy symbol (similar to üíæ) in the `matplotlib` window.

## Remarks

- The script is benchmarked against the `mcal` program from Dr. Eckhard Bill.
  Within the given restrictions, the results match quite well.
- Raw spectra (WissEl .ws5 for example) are expected to start at channel 1 and be folded to the right.
- With the `-fl` option the raw spectrum can be folded to the left.
- `FP` is the mean of the centers of the individual Lorentz functions (4, 8 or 12) of the raw spectrum.
- `v0` is the mean of the centers of the individual Lorentz functions (2, 4 or 6) of the folded spectrum.
- `f` is the mean of `f` calculated with $\Delta E_Q$ from ‚Åµ‚Å∑Fe divided by the difference of the
   single Lorentz functions form the outermost to the innermost pair (see also comment in the script).
- `vmax` is  `f * 127.5` in case of 256 channels. 
- The script has not been tested with raw data from 1024 channel multi-channel analyzers.
